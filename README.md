### Abstract

This project â€œSchool Management System '' provides us a simple interface for maintenance of students,teachers,courses and attendance information.It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to maintain the records of school data easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project. 

### Login Module: 
Initially we will be implementing a login facility which allows access to authorized users only. On successful login, the user will be directed to the home page which has a sidebar with contents like dashboard, student, teacher, subjects, attendance and attendance-report. The login page leads to a dashboard which displays school logo, details about the school, announcements and logout option. 

### Student page: 
The student page displays the details such as name, roll number, picture, class, section of all the students with an option to update, delete and enter the new student details. 

### Teacher page: 
Similarly the teachers page displays the details such as id, name, assigned-subjects and classes of teachers. Subjects page: Subjects page contains the details of all courses taught in the school. 

### Attendance Page: 
Attendance of a particular class (selected using the search bar) is updated at the end of the 1day by the admin. This web application will ease the work of maintenance of student reports.
